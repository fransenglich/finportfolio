\maketitle

My idea is it would be wise to save for pension or large investment such as an apartment. My interest in this, beyond the end result, is limited: I have no intension to spend time on fundamental analysis or follow developments on a regular basis. However, I do write this document, and I intend to do a modern portfolio theory (MPT) analysis of the portfolio. I have in interest to sleep well, without worrying about this.

Individual stocks are, as far as I can tell, hence irrelevant because I won't manage it, rebalance, and so forth. Therefore I think it makes sense to look at passive indices and active management.

The computations contains no strategic decisions, they are a procedural, technical matter. The interesting questions is what assets to choose, and that is the hard part, not calculating the portfolio weights.

\section{Details}

This is the broad picture:

\begin{itemize}
\item "Long" horizon. Easily 5-10 years
\item Generally offensive/"high" risk investment
\item Bank of choice is Avanza in Sweden
\item Other banks of mine are Nordea in Sweden and Norway. A student's economy, only savings accounts
\item Account type for the investments: Investeringssparkonto (ISK)
\item Start amount: 10 000 SEK
\item Monthly investment: 500 SEK.
\end{itemize}

In short, according to my very shallow approach to this, I say it achieves diversification across USA, Europe and Sweden, and is high return/risk. Therefore it matches my objectives.

\section{A Modern Portfolio Theory Analysis}

The objective is to maximise the portfolio's Sharpe ratio and acquire informational key figures. That is, the tangency portfolio is of interest. Therefore I will compute the portfolio's:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean-variance efficient asset weights
    \item Efficient frontier
    \item Expected return
    \item Standard deviation
    \item Sharpe ratio.
% VaR?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mean-variance Efficient Frontier}

Mathematically, the problem is:

\begin{equation*}
    \max_{w} w'\mu
\end{equation*}

\(w\) is a \(N\times1\) vector of asset weights, where \(N\) is the number of assets. $\mu$ is a \(N\times1\) vector of expected returns. The solution can be found in the mean-variance efficient frontier, which is:

\begin{equation*}
    \bar{u}_p = \frac{A}{C} + \frac{1}{C} \sqrt{(C\sigma^2_p - 1)(BC - A^2)},
\end{equation*}

where

\begin{align*}
    A &= \mu'\Sigma^{-1}\iota  \\
    B &= \mu'\Sigma^{-1}\mu    \\
    C &= \iota\Sigma^{-1}\iota \\
\end{align*}

$\Sigma$ is an \(N\times N\) variance-covariance matrix of returns, $\iota$ an \(N\times 1\) vector of ones.

The mean-variance frontier for the portfolio is plotted in figure \ref{figure_mv_frontier}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{generated_mv_frontier.eps}
    \caption{Mean-variance frontier of portfolio.}
    \label{figure_mv_frontier}
\end{figure}

\section{Optimal Weights}

The definition of optimal weights is those that give maximum return. Another definition could have been that which leads to minimum variance, that is, catering to risk aversion.

The theoretically optimal weights may involve shorting, but due to the bank not allowing this and that simplicity is preferred, the optimisation has been constrained to not include shorting. No position is taken in the risk-free asset.

The optimal weights of the assets in the portfolio are found in table \ref{table_optimal_weights}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l| }
        \hline
        Asset Name & Weighting & Weighting (\%) \\
        \hline

        \input{generated_weights.tex}

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Optimal weights.}
    \label{table_optimal_weights}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The Sharpe ratio of the portfolio is $\approx$\optSR.

However, \citet{naive_div} concludes that naive diversification outperforms the mean-variance based determination of weights, in terms of Sharpe ratio.
