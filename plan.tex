\maketitle

My idea is it would be wise to save for pension or large investment such as an apartment. My interest in this, beyond the end result, is limited: I have no intension to spend time on fundamental analysis or follow developments on a regular basis. However, I do write this document, and I intend to do a modern portfolio theory (MPT) analysis of the portfolio. I have in interest to sleep well, without worrying about this.

Individual stocks are, as far as I can tell, hence irrelevant because I won't manage it, rebalance, and so forth. Therefore I think it makes sense to look at passive indices and active management.
